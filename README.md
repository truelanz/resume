### Hello, this is my Resume project.

I started by making two references in Figma for my resume website:

<a href="https://imgur.com/CIZcZqs"><img style="height:300px;"  src="https://i.imgur.com/CIZcZqs.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>
<a href="https://imgur.com/ITkwBgF"><img style="height:300px;" src="https://i.imgur.com/ITkwBgF.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>

I didn't use any Framework to do this, just a [sweetalert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/) popup component and the [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to do the build. And I got some beautiful icons from [icons8](https://icons8.com/)
 I only used:
  - Js
  - CSS
  - HTML.

I am improving some things in this project. But you can use this base if you want and modify it for your use.
